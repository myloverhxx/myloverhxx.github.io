We charge customers in USD but we are forced to convert to SGD and conversion fees adds up. On 99USD charge, with the current conversion, we get around 138 SGD but the net for us is 133 SGD because the processing fee is ~5.20SGD. That fee was lower before.\nThere is no problem for us getting an extension of our account in USD currency so we could avoid unnecessary conversion USD-&gt;SGD fees.</p><p>2. Chargebacks. A real pain in the ass. I shared a post on IH about it. Basically there is no way for us to issue someone a refund if they are doing a chargeback. This is a real problem that is relatively easy to solve. PayPal does it - basically, if the customer submits dispute, PayPal first tries to contact the seller to voluntarily provide the refund and only if they refuse, the dispute is being reviewed. Why Stripe cannot work this way? That would save a lot of drama and stress involved running the business for both sides - you and us, your customers.</p><p>3. Pricing info. It&#x27;s still very confusing on your website to understand what and how you charge for particular add-ons and whether we are grandfathered and have these add-on services included free of charge (since we have been with you since 2016).</p>",points:null,parent_id:22889778,story_id:22889778,children:[{id:22895398,created_at:"2020-04-17T01:34:22.000Z",created_at_i:1587087262,type:"comment",author:"patio11",title:null,url:null,text:"<p>We can potentially help you avoid that currency round-trip.

Many of the replies actually reinforce my point.</p><p>That could be restaurants that provide better quality food than the large chain restaurants. It could be a butchers that provide higher quality locally sourced meats than what I can get at Safeway and Walmart. It could be businesses making specialized gear that I use in my outdoor endeavors (Hyperlite Mountain Gear, Mountain Laurel Designs, Astral, Kokatat, Alpacka Raft, etc. etc.). It can be businesses that sell things the big businesses don&#x27;t such as a specialty wine shop. There are tons of good small businesses that provide superior value. Selling the same products as Amazon and Walmart at a higher price with poorer customer service and worse return policy doesn&#x27;t provide superior value.</p><p>A good business is one that provides superior value. Being large or small tells me nothing about the value being provided.</p><p>Everyone focusing on things like pricing power is missing the forest for the trees. If you don&#x27;t have pricing power, the money is still leaving the community. Instead of going to the middleman that lives far away, it just goes to the manufacturers that live far away.</p><p>Furthermore, many of these large companies are public, which means everyone within any community has the opportunity of buying a piece of the company on the open market. The communities that buy the most of such large companies probably even keep more wealth in their community than the ones that don&#x27;t. If enough local people buy shares, then it&#x27;s possible that more profits flow into that particular community than flow out of that community.</p><p>With a small local retailer, it just means the money flows into the pocket of one person or one family in the community and no one else in the community can buy into that business and get the benefits of the value generated. This is what happens in places like Lake Chelan in Washington, where one family (the Campbells) has a stranglehold on politics and funnels everything to their businesses, which no one else locally is able to buy into.</p><p>Strong communities with a solid local economy are those that have many such small businesses that provide superior value.

I elaborated on why we ruled it out in another comment[1].</p><p>To explain where we&#x27;re coming from here, I personally learned a classic first-time entrepreneur lesson the hard way some years ago: if we&#x27;re not a payments business then we should focus on what we are, not on payment mechanics.</p><p>The first time I started a B2C, I naively thought I could do better, and to be fair, I really did implement a simple, robust, flexible system that fit our needs well. But over time, even the better payment services started breaking APIs and neglecting documentation and dropping customer service standards and increasing prices, and maintaining those integrations became painful. Governments started changing their regulations and tax rules, and updating our systems to keep up with the ever-changing compliance and tax obligations become painful too. We also found that fraud and chargebacks weren&#x27;t a significant problem for us, but surprisingly, churn due to unreliable card charges was unbelievably bad and could turn an otherwise healthy growth rate negative all on its own, which was not a good combination with the aforementioned drop in standards at the payment services.</p><p>What we&#x27;re now looking for, in a nutshell, is a service to which we can outsource payment processing, subscription management, and all of the sales tax collection, reporting and remittance obligations. I don&#x27;t want to use APIs or webhooks any more than I absolutely have to. I want to fill in correct, context-aware, all-inclusive prices on our pricing page with ideally one line of code. I want to hand our customers off smoothly to a well-designed, batteries-included sign-up flow with ideally one line of code. I want a simple notification to reach my server when a customer has paid us so we can have our systems respond accordingly, and I want simple notifications if anything has gone wrong so we can contact our customer or payment service and deal with it.</p><p>I do not want to know what the current sales tax rates are in Western Nowhere, Somecountry, and I certainly do not want to have to sign up for a government programme and file reports and remit taxes there because once upon a time we had one customer who signed up for one month and we collected 1.50 Nowheredollars in sales tax.</p><p>I do not want to have any UI on my site and therefore any code behind it for upgrading, downgrading, cancelling, refunding, retrying failed charges or sending flowers on my customer&#x27;s birthday, except to the extent that we provide a simple way for a customer to indicate they want to do something and we can then hand off the mechanics to the payment service if we agree, again ideally with one line of code.</p><p>I do want a simple, effective dashboard facility on the payment service that lets me see and control all of those things (well, maybe not the flowers) and any other relevant settings if I want to, and I want it to be somebody else&#x27;s problem to implement and maintain that facility.</p><p>I don&#x27;t know what proportion of our revenues we&#x27;d be willing to give up for a service like that, but it would be <i>far</i> higher than anything we pay to any payment service today.</p><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22896600" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22896600</a></p>',points:null,parent_id:22897382,story_id:22889778,children:[],options:[]}],options:[]}],options:[]}],options:[]},{id:22893184,created_at:"2020-04-16T20:28:18.000Z",created_at_i:1587068898,type:"comment",author:"Silhouette",title:null,url:null,text:"<p>We looked into Paddle recently as a possible way of handling the payment mechanics and the tax and compliance issues for a new business.

You have a giant feature gap, but also an org problem I think and I would like to explain because I have been trying to get the giant feature gap filled for about 3 years and people there seem to do whatever the opposite of caring is.  It relates to being able to test production environments safely, which in our opinion is something every company should do extensive production testing.</p><p>Based on many support conversations with me trying to get a feature built here over the last year, Stripe&#x27;s &quot;official position&quot; appears to be &quot;never test your production application.&quot; Sometimes they say &quot;do it but only for $1 every other month&quot;, which is functionally the same as saying &quot;don&#x27;t ever test production.&quot; if you don&#x27;t have any products or services for $1 and do regular deployments.</p><p>I understand the reasons why you don&#x27;t want people using live credit cards to test in production (e.g. factoring), but that isn&#x27;t what I think most users want to do (it is not what we want to use). We don&#x27;t want to use real cards at all but we want to test production.</p><p>The best answer to customers who want to test in production is to give them the ability to safety test live cards.  Please see the attached specification I pulled together which would solve this problem for Stripe, card networks, and your customers. If Stripe cannot implement some feature like &quot;Safe Live Testing&quot;, then we will ultimately be forced to migrate away from Stripe. This is a critical feature for us, and I am sure many customers.</p><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidy-static-websites.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com&#x2F;Stripe+Safe+Live+Testing+Spec.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidy-static-websites.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com&#x2F;Stri...</a></p><p>We thought our integration with stripe was down in production last week, and we could not run any checks to tell if that was actually the case. This would have fixed it for us.</p><p>I think there is also a cultural issue here because I believe any mention of &quot;production testing&quot; is currently falling in the compliance camp of Stripe.  Which means their job is to prevent fraud, but nobody seems to say &quot;its ok to want this. The response every time from support and compliance teams is basically &quot;you are bad to test in production, never do it.&quot; But they instead should say &quot;I totally understand why you would want to test your production site.  This is a gap on our side, and we should fix it.&quot; If there is an issue with Visa&#x2F;Mastercard agreements or something, then they should say &quot;I totally understand why you would want to test your production site.  We are completely unable to support it because Visa has this rule that says X, we are working with them to change it. Here is how you can contact Visa to express your support for the rule change, we are spearheading a campaign to ensure customers can do this.&quot;</p><p>I hope this feedback is helpful, and while the &quot;spec&quot; is not very good, I did put substantial effort into thinking through a solution here, so I hope you review it and get it to the right team.

How is whether a business is &quot;quality&quot; or not being judged by a credit card processing provider? What information is obtained to make judgments according to these metrics?</p><p>I&#x27;ve been in different online and in-person businesses. Some businesses have low refund rate with poor quality, others high refund rate with fine quality. I can say with certainty 100% of the refunds I gave when people sent back a product that was not the product I sent them(or even a product I sell) after they filed a chargeback had nothing to do with the quality of our business - the only thing the merchant would have access to is a he-said-she-said list of jpg files and ranting paragraphs. Hardly fitting information to judge the quality of a business on.</p><p>Honestly, I&#x27;ve looked as Stripe&#x27;s offerings - I pay 2.15% right now with 40&#x2F;60 online card not present&#x2F;in-store card present and refunds are free. How is it with a 2.9% fee that people who rarely refund their customers have to pay the fee for those customers for the model to make sense? I&#x27;m not asking Stripe to match the fee of a large bank - but can we not charge an additional .7 percent and then say &quot;it has to be done so we don&#x27;t lose when people refund?&quot;</p><p>This is outside the greater implications of this policy - if more merchant services take this on, we will be left with a world where only Amazon, eBay, and Walmart can offer &quot;cancel&quot; buttons on their site. Who will want to do business with small businesses if even something as basic as hitting the cancel button incurs fees?</p><p>If I buy a TV, or an ultrasonic cleaner, or a stereo, or some furniture from a small business vs amazon and I mess up something in my order, I have to pay a $45 fee - but when I buy it from amazon, I don&#x27;t? Screw them, I&#x27;ll use amazon.</p><p>If this is adopted by every single business, it will be just one of many factors that pushes customers in the direction of using Amazon over small businesses. It&#x27;s hard enough competing with trillion dollar companies as is without erroneous fees being added in that were outside the overton window of business discussion 10 years ago.</p><p>To be clear, I have no problem with people choosing to make purchases from Amazon. I do have an issue with the industry slowly adding barriers to small businesses having the ability to compete on a level playing field. I&#x27;m all for them earning a good reputation, but we shouldn&#x27;t be working to put sour tastes in the mouths of every customer who f&#x27;d up and made an order in error with someone that they will not have with a larger company.</p>",points:null,parent_id:22895226,story_id:22889778,children:[],options:[]}],options:[]}],options:[]}],options:[]},{id:22893629,created_at:"2020-04-16T21:13:10.000Z",created_at_i:1587071590,type:"comment",author:"sealthedeal",title:null,url:null,text:"<p>You should consider chatting with us @routefusion :)</p><p>developer.routefusion.co</p><p>we will solve all of those nasty FX problems your customers are having.

They backed down temporarily after people made a stink about it, but months later continued forward with the policy. I currently use a merchant services provider that does not implement these fees, but for how long?</p><p>My time in my industry has taught me that companies will often wait for one “outlier” to make controversial reforms to their platform&#x2F;products before doing it themselves. Whether it is gluing the battery inside of a cellphone, or adding strange fees to transactions. Once a profitable, anti-consumer move succeeds with the company not going out of business, it emboldens other firms to do the same.</p><p>My merchant services provider doesn’t charge this fee. Yet. But they saw Stripe charge it, and get away with it. They saw PayPal charge it and have another more profitable quarter. The outrage lasted a week, the increased profit lasted forever. “Gee, it isn’t a business killer after all. Maybe we should do it too!” will come up in corporate boardrooms across America.</p><p>Then, we’re left with a landscape where the only companies left in ecommerce who can offer customers friction-free order cancellations are Amazon, eBay, and Walmart. Who wants that? Yes, people can say “just absorb the fee if you don’t want your customers to be mad at you.” How? I am already competing as a dude with no outside financing with a trillion dollar company – I’m winning if I am making any sales at all! Now I’m expected to compete on price when I have to absorb fees when customers cancel an order?</p><p>Let’s say you manage to claw your way into a market by offering a better product, or after sales service on that product to the point where you can compete with Amazon. That is a miracle in and of itself. To then have to deal with a minefield of additional charges that your competitor doesn’t have to is just another nail in the coffin of small-business ecommerce.</p><p>I find it awful, and I protest using these services. I cut my exposure to paypal by about 95% and dodged a bullet in not signing up for stripe. I suggest the same to my listenership anytime someone brings up or mentions a merchant services provider that I know charges this fee. Even if they say it won&#x27;t affect their business much because they do not deal with lots of cancellations, it is the greater implication I make them aware of. No one wants a market where the only companies with a free &quot;cancel order&quot; button on their site are eBay and Amazon.</p><p>Scott Galloway also has a lot of excellent content with arguments on breaking up Amazon. Whether or not one agrees with his solutions or assessments of the problems Amazon creates and how to fix them – it is clear that they are dominating the race. I am not suggesting that we hold Amazon back – just that we don’t purposely trip companies doing their best to keep up.</p>",points:null,parent_id:22890523,story_id:22889778,children:[{id:22896598,created_at:"2020-04-17T05:58:47.000Z",created_at_i:1587103127,type:"comment",author:"areoform",title:null,url:null,text:'<p>Wait, are you <i>the</i> Louis Rossmann? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;rossmanngroup" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;rossmanngroup</a></p>',points:null,parent_id:22896582,story_id:22889778,children:[{id:22896639,created_at:"2020-04-17T06:07:00.000Z",created_at_i:1587103620,type:"comment",author:"larossmann",title:null,url:null,text:"<p>That depends, are you a collections agent or process server?</p>",points:null,parent_id:22896598,story_id:22889778,children:[],options:[]}],options:[]}],options:[]},{id:22892999,created_at:"2020-04-16T20:11:09.000Z",created_at_i:1587067869,type:"comment",author:"wegymoo",title:null,url:null,text:"<p>I&#x27;ve been making lots of little business apps and integrating them with Stripe.

Go a step further and encourage sites to stop making users create accounts. SSO-style system, perhaps, but easy to integrate.

Therefore, they can be caught to in many areas. Take for example stripe. They are almost exclusively online and offer a bundled transaction rate. By simply focusing on areas like offline payments or more flexible&#x2F;customizable rates a company could easily beat them.</p><p>For PayPal, they are much larger, you could do the same. You will not beat them over night but you can easily find niches where a more tailored approach would benefit the businesses rather than the broad strokes a company of that size has to take.</p><p>One area to look at for both would be online sales.

Out of many many thousands of transactions, I&#x27;ve only had about 3 or 4 transactions get flagged as high risk by PayPal. What this means is PayPal will hold the funds, review the transaction and then either give you the funds if it&#x27;s legit or do something else if it&#x27;s not legit.</p><p>I&#x27;ve had 0 cases on PayPal where fraud &#x2F; disputes actually took place. Of those 3-4 transactions, they were all released. None of this required any intervention by me. I just got notified by email from PayPal when a high risk transaction occurred. 100% of the funds were put back into my account a few days later (short of the normal 2.9% + 30c fees).</p><p>On Stripe, I&#x27;ve also had many many thousands of transactions. I&#x27;ve had a number of fraud transactions in the process which ended up as disputes. Stripe sends out an email letting you know, but then it&#x27;s now on you to decide if you want to contest the dispute. This dispute typically happens when someone who got their credit card stolen sees an unknown charge in their records.</p><p>Now you need to fill out like 8 form fields and supply screenshots and server logs of proof that someone was accessing the material they&#x27;ve stolen (I sell digital courses so there&#x27;s no physical item). The screenshots need to be sized perfectly to be displayed in portrait mode on a sheet of paper that gets faxed over to the person reviewing it from the bank, otherwise it&#x27;ll be unreadable from their perspective and you&#x27;ll auto-lose the case.</p><p>Stripe doesn&#x27;t let you see a real preview of these screenshots and they even alter the uploaded image size in your preview which makes it hard to preview what it will look like from the reviewer&#x27;s POV even though that&#x27;s the only thing that matters.</p><p>After doing that, it takes about 2-3 months to get a resolution. You get charged a $15 bank dispute fee (on top of the full amount of the product of course) which is non-refundable unless you happen to win the dispute, but if someone got their card stolen then you&#x27;re not going to win the case. You also don&#x27;t get any information from Stripe about the review, other than you won or lost. Stripe says it&#x27;s because banks don&#x27;t give them any info beyond that. Fine, that&#x27;s ok, but yeah the overall experience is very very bad.</p><p>Then on top of that, Stripe sells a Radar service that you need to pay extra on top of for each transaction to get better tools to help prevent fraud before it takes place.

You currently have one factory, for a profit of $1M&#x2F;year, and a new factory costs $8M to build.

After 14 years of putting all the profits into making new factories, you can enjoy watching the money flow in.</p><p>Now suppose you were able to convince investors to give you $24M to build three more factories immediately, in exchange for some percentage of the business. You&#x27;re <i>immediately</i> making $4M&#x2F;year, minus whatever percentage goes to your investors.

GoCardless is similarly trying to shift how people pay for things online away from the fragile and unreliable card networks.</p><p>Unfortunately, at least for some of us, the problems these services are solving are becoming secondary. The biggest pain points now, as a business selling services online from the UK, tend to be about regulatory compliance issues that increasingly conflict with clean, user-friendly payment processes and about the increasing complexity of global VAT&#x2F;sales tax rules (and the ever more hostile rhetoric combined with often unrealistic demands from many governments in connection with the same).</p><p>I&#x27;m looking at setting up a new business at the moment, and our initial assumption is that we won&#x27;t be using services like Stripe and GoCardless at all any more, even though I&#x27;ve built modestly successful businesses with them in the past. We just don&#x27;t have time for all of the compliance and tax hassle in every country in the world where someone might buy from us, and while Stripe&#x27;s new samples and guides have helped with showing how to get their new PSD2-friendly API to work, they also serve to show how horrifically complicated the once-simple process of charging a card online is now becoming. In the near future, I suspect this will push many of us into using marketplace or merchant-of-record arrangements and just outsourcing the whole shebang to businesses large enough to deal with those issues properly, who will no doubt take a larger cut of the revenues in return.</p><p>You&#x27;d think governments would have been solving these problems at an international level decades ago, but many of them aren&#x27;t even following the general OECD guidelines they&#x27;ve theoretically agreed.
